# Nature Explore and Actuators

## Forest Park Exploration Record
This week we went to a forest park and spent some time involving ourselves in the nature. During this process, we used our different senses to sense the nature and captured some pheonamenon interesting, which could give us some ideas and be potential to create something helping reducing the distance betweeen citizens and city nature. The following is what I have felt and thought in this exploration.

### Using Medium to Create a Sense of Immersion

My Feeling:
It's easy to find that people in this park immerse greatly themselves in nature, they are playing Taichi, flying kites, playing instruments and so on. There is a good balance and harmony between them and nature, which is rare in other busy part of the city just like our school. So, the key to their immersion is all of them have a type of **tool or medium**(Taichi,kite,music...) to integrate into nature. So maybe we can also create a medium to help create a sense of immersion.
